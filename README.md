###  A product management syndication tool.
* Using their API we want to bring in products that meet certain criteria. Then we would have the ability to pull the fields of woocommerce and map them to the fields from Salsify. The ordering and shipping process would remain in Woocommerce. The only updating that would occur back to Salsify would be inventory updates. This feature will need the ability to turn on or off.

### List of Features:
- Add multiple feeds and be able to manage them independently.
- Create woocommerce products based on the salsify fields
- Ability to map fields from Salsify to Woocommerce on a per field basis
- Sync inventories between systems multiple times a day. This feature would be able to deactivated per feed.
- If a product is no longer in the feed from Salsify it would delete the product.
- Ability to filter the feed from salsify to limit the products imported by category or status.
